      <h2 id="heading-overview">What is Organic Farming?</h2>
      <p>Organic farming is a method of agriculture that avoids synthetic chemicals and emphasizes natural processes, biodiversity, and soil health. <br> It focuses on producing food in a way that maintains ecological balance and promotes sustainability.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>It improves soil fertility naturally.</li>
        <li>It reduces environmental pollution.</li>
        <li>It produces healthier and safer food.</li>
        <li>It supports biodiversity and wildlife.</li>

      <h2 id="heading-methods">Common Organic Farming Methods</h2>
<p> Some of the common methods of organic farming are as follows:
      <article>
        <h3>Crop Rotation</h3>
        <p>This practice involves growing different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons to maintain soil fertility and prevent pests.
        <br>Crop rotation aids in revitalizing soil nutrients, minimizing pest and disease issues, and boosting overall soil quality, which ultimately supports increased crop yields and promotes sustainable agricultural practices.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Composting</h3>
        <p>Composting is the process of recycling organic waste (such as plant residues, animal manure and kitchen scraps) into nutrient-rich fertilizer for crops and gardens.
            <br> Compost provides garden crops with three key nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Additionally, it supplies small amounts of other vital elements such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc. Composting serves as an organic alternative to synthetic fertilizers.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Biological Pest Control</h3>
        <p>Biological pest control in organic farming is a natural and sustainable method that involves introducing or encouraging natural predators, parasites, or pathogens to manage pest populations without relying on synthetic pesticides. 
            <br>Instead of chemical pesticides, organic farmers use living organisms (also called biological control agents) to keep harmful pest populations in check.
